# Capacitor-Discharge
This project is designed to fully automate Core Practical 11 from Edexcel A Level Physics. This has been completed using an Arduino and a breadboard following this schematic:

The circuit above was recreated on a breadboard as shown below

By loading the .ino file to the arduino, and running the python script on a computer connected to the arduino by a serial cable (arduino assumed to be connected to COM3, this can be configured in the python script), the program will complete a set amount of tests, and store the results to a .xlsx file once completed. Images will also be generated at the end of each test of the discharge curve generated. Please configure the locations these files will be saved to before you run the project yourself.
