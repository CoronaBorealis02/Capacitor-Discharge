# Capacitor-Discharge
This project is designed to fully automate Core Practical 11 from Edexcel A Level Physics. This has been completed using an Arduino and a breadboard following this schematic:

The circuit above was recreated on a breadboard as shown below

By loading the .ino file to the arduino, and running the python script on a computer connected to the arduino by a serial cable, the program will complete a set amount of tests, and store the results to a .xlsx file once completed. Images will also be generated at the end of each test of the discharge curve generated.
